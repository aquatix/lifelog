Generate an HTML version of a Markdown logbook. Content is enriched with
images/photographs of that day, Sleep as Android sleep stats, Google Fit steps
and the weather.

`lifelog` outputs a [paragoo](https://github.com/aquatix/paragoo) project, which
can be rendered to HTML. Use the [paragoo-theme-lifelog](https://github.com/aquatix/paragoo-theme-material)
